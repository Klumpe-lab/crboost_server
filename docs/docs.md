## CryoBoost Containerized Relion Orchestration

The orchestration layer, primarily implemented in `pipeline_orchestrator_service.py`, manages Relion pipeline execution by interfacing with Relion's native scheduling system. It handles job sequencing through custom scheme creation, dynamic STAR file manipulation, and workflow progression monitoring. The service constructs complete pipeline schemes by copying job templates, modifying parameters via `starfile_service.py`, and establishing proper job dependencies through input/output STAR file linking.

Backend integration in `backend.py` provides the container execution foundation, with the `_run_containerized_relion()` method handling environment isolation by unsetting conflicting variables and setting clean paths. The system coordinates between Relion's `relion_pipeliner` for job registration and `relion_schemer` for workflow execution, while maintaining SLURM compatibility through qsub script management. This architecture separates container management from pipeline logic, allowing reliable execution of complex tomography workflows while leveraging Relion's built-in scheduling capabilities for distributed processing across HPC resources.
