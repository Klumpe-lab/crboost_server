This is a cryoet job orchestrator project.
Currently a few jobs work and succeed in the pipeline, but the pipelines can be pretty long and each job takes time so it would be nice to be able to "come back" to a project where a few jobs have succeeded and not start from scratch. What do you think?

The general data flow is that parameters are collected by the job model from the global state (populated either from the defaults or via the ui -- you don't need concern yourself with that too much, it works). When the user begins the pipeline, the schemes are created and qsub slurm job script is copied from the config directory. Then the pipeline begins via the "pipeline_runner", which initiates the relion pipeline by invoking relion schemer in the appropriate container. Then relion dispatches one job after anohter by means of looking up their job_star's fn_exe and seeing that we have put the appropriate python "driver" there, substituting the string of this driver invocation into the XXXcommandXXX in our qsub slurm script and submitting this slurm script to the queue. Lastly, the given job's driver is executed on the compute node and knows how to call the appropriate tool (whether containerized or not -- right now all our tools are containerized) to do the heavy computational workload and then after that possibly some metadata processing for the results of that job or some other housekeeping defined in the driver. Once the driver is done -- it created a relion sentinel file (one of RELION_JOB_EXIT_SUCCESS or RELION_JOB_EXIT_FAILURE) and return the appropriate exit code whereby the slurm job ends and the control returns back to relion_schemer which, if the last job suceeded, creates the next as described above.

The completeness of jobs can basically be checked via checking each job's directory for Relion sentinel files or via the . That should be good enough for us for starters. Furhermore we already have functionality built in for each particular job type to resolve the paths for its files and inputs relative to the project root folder.
