# CryoBoost Server

```
I think the best would be something like that and you start the flask server on the headnode and interact with it throgh the browser of your labtop or whatever.

https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/quickstart/#a-minimal-application

The only remaining problem would be the container for the applicaion if needed.

And of course we can still seperate the interactive from the server process.

Should we talk again ?
